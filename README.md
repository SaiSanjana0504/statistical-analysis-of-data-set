# Statistical Analysis with Python: Quick Notes

# Basic Concepts

- **Population**: Complete set of observations (e.g., all adults in a city).
- **Sample**: Subset of the population (e.g., 500 adults from the city).

**Need for Sampling**:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces costs.
- **Time Efficiency**: Provides quicker results.
- **Feasibility**: Often impractical to study the entire population.
- **Manageability**: Simplifies analysis.

**Benefits of Sampling**:
- **Accuracy**: Reflects the population accurately.
- **Less Data Overhead**: Easier to manage.
- **Focused Research**: Allows detailed analysis.

# Basic Statistical Methods

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize data features.
  - **Mean**: Average value.
  - **Median**: Middle value; robust to outliers.
  - **Mode**: Most frequent value.
  - **Standard Deviation (SD)**: Measures variability.
  - **Variance**: Average squared deviation from the mean.
  - **Range**: Difference between max and min values.
  - **Percentiles/Quartiles**: Insights into data distribution.
  - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Range of the middle 50% of values.
  - **Skewness**: Measures asymmetry in data distribution.
  - **Kurtosis**: Measures the "tailedness" of the distribution.

- **Inferential Statistics**: Make predictions or generalizations.
  - **Hypothesis Testing**: Tests hypotheses about populations.
  - **Confidence Intervals**: Range likely containing the true population parameter.
  - **Regression Analysis**: Models relationships between variables.
  - **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Compares means across multiple groups.
  - **Chi-Square Test**: Tests the independence of categorical variables.

# Python for Statistical Analysis

**Install Libraries**:
- Use `pip` to install libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`.

# Applying Statistical Methods

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize dataset features such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range, percentiles, IQR, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Inferential Statistics**:
  - **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluate hypotheses based on sample data.
  - **Confidence Intervals**: Estimate a range for the population parameter.
  - **Regression Analysis**: Examine relationships between variables.
  - **ANOVA**: Compare means of multiple groups.
  - **Chi-Square Test**: Analyze relationships between categorical variables.
